# Exercises

After getting the demo app to work, try to improve it in the following ways:

1. **Add a second graph** that shows the change in Median Household Income over time. You can do this by copy-pasting the
   code that makes the Population graph and modifying it slightly. Place the new graph below the Population graph.
1. **Add a second select box** that lets users select which demographic to display (i.e., Population or Income).
1. **Use the value from both select boxes** to determine which graph to show. For example, if the user selects "New York"
   and "Median Household Income", display only the Income graph for New York.
1. **Separate the graph and table into tabs** to improve the layout. Create
   two tabs: one called "Graphs" and the other called "Table". Hint: look at the example code on Streamlit's
   documentation page for tabs
   ([link](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/layout/st.tabs)).
